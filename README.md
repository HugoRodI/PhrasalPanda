# PhrasalPanda

PhrasalPanda is a game to practice the study of 'Phrasal verbs'. Phrasal verbs
are asked to the user, who has to select between a set of four possible options.
When the user run out of lives, the game is over!

## Features
- The Fisher-Yates shuffle is used to shuffle the phrasal verb. That means 
 that the order in which the verbs are asked changes from one game execution to
 other.
- PhrasalPanda reads the verbs from the file PhrasalPanda/Verbs/PhrasalVerbs.txt.
 In order to add more verbs or to modify the (few) existing change that file.
 It follows the format: Phrasal verb name;Phrasal verb meaning.
